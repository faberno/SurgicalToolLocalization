\subsection{Objectives}

Our goal was to implement a ML-model-architecture that can be trained on different weakly-annotated endoscopic image-datasets to label and localize tools. 

\subsection{Structure}
In a first part we will describe the problem in more depth. After that we will give a short introduction into existing literature, both on image-classification as well as localization tasks, with a focus on papers that cover similar problems like the one at hand. Connected to this introduction into existing literature we cover ML-tools that should be known in order to better follow the actual contend of the work. 
In the methodology-chapter we firstly dive into the early considerations and present our first approach, since this allows us to better illustrate the challenges and discoveries made in the process. Additionally we describe the data-management-process.
We then explain the model we finally developed and the training-strategy. We finish naming our quality metrics and success-definition.
The perhaps most illustrating part, the experiments-section, helps explain the design-decisions we made on the way. Additionally, we describe in greater depth the three datasets we used. We close encouraging further work in the field.
